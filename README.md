CellSim: Life in Motion
CellSim: Life in Motion is a dynamic and customizable cellular automata simulation inspired by Conway's Game of Life. Built with Python and Pygame, this simulation allows users to observe how simple rule-based entities evolve over time in a grid-based environment.

ðŸ§¬ Features
A modern extension of Conway's Game of Life with customizable rules.

Real-time simulation of living and dying cells based on neighbor interactions.

Interactive GUI to start, pause, reset, and randomize the grid.

Adjustable simulation speed and cell size.

Clear visual distinction between alive and dead cells.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

pygame library

Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Pradeepta15/CellSim-Life-in-Motion.git
cd CellSim-Life-in-Motion
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
ðŸŽ® Controls
Spacebar: Start/Pause the simulation

R: Randomize the grid

C: Clear all cells

Arrow Keys: Increase or decrease simulation speed

ðŸ§  How It Works
Each cell on the grid follows simple rules to determine whether it survives, dies, or is born in the next generation based on the number of living neighbors. This produces emergent behavior over time, illustrating how complexity can arise from simplicity.
